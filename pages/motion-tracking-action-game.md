<p>The Motion Tracking Action Game project aims to create an immersive exer-game experience using a flat display-based system, which merges physical reality with virtual environments. The concept revolves around the idea of the multiverse, where different versions of a character exist across multiple universes. To convey this concept, the game employs a mirror (portal) mechanism, allowing users to see their avatars move in sync within the multiverse through a flat display. This approach eliminates the need for VR head-mounted displays (HMDs) while still providing a sense of depth and immersion through advanced perspective-shifting technology and full-body tracking.</p>

<p>The game narrative involves a character named Eric from Earth-219 who seeks the player's help against an attacking enemy. The player, situated on Earth-372, interacts with Eric through the portal created by the flat display. The system uses motion tracking to map the player’s movements onto their avatar, enabling intuitive interactions such as fighting off enemies. The game’s immersive experience is heightened by synchronized animations and reactive audio-visual feedback, making it a compelling exercise and entertainment platform.</p>
